## Norm editor demonstration (FLINT)

This is a demonstration of how can natural language text be translated into FLINT specification. This demonstration uses an example of regulations about rental house renovation subsidies (according to this [blogpost](https://dudoklegal.nl/en/current-events/subsidy-for-the-sustainability-of-rental-housing/)). This process uses the [choppr](https://choppr.app/) and [norm editor](https://rule-editor.netlify.app/) web tools.
